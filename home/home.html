However, I resumed coding in the year 2022, and up until now (<span id="currentDate"></span>), I can say I'm competent but never better at <span class="decent"></span><span class="cursor"></span></p>
                            <p>I'm excited to make the leap and continue refining my skills in the world of programming.</span>

                            <p>>&nbsp;<span>[ 2<sup>nd</sup> Class ]</span> (GE US) Lesson 1: The Self from Various Philosophical Perspectives. The history of philosophy is replete with men and women who inquired into the fundamental nature of the self. The Greeks were the ones who seriously questioned myths and moved away from them in attempting to understand reality and respond to perennial questions of curiosity, including the question of the self.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Socrates - praised as the greatest philosopher in the western civilization, stated that man is a being who thinks and wills. For Socrates the human person is composed of Body and Soul. This means that every human person is dualistic. The soul should be nurtured properly through its acquisition of knowledge, wisdom and virtue. For him, a man who converges the two into one is a wise man, a man of wisdom.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Plato - the nature of man is seen in the metaphysical dichotomy between body and soul. The body is material; it cannot live and move apart from the soul; it is mutable and destructible. On the contrary, the soul is immaterial; it can exist apart from the body; it is immutable and indestructible. In Plato's view, the soul has three parts: it has a rational part, an appetitive part, and a spiritual part. Because man is a soul using body, three parts of the soul each has its locus in the body. The rational part is in the head, specifically in the brain; the appetitive part, in the abdomen; and the spiritual part, in the chest.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;St. Augustine - Following the olden view of Plato and infusing it with the new doctrine of Christianity, Augustine settled that man is of a bifurcated nature. The Body is bound to die on earth and the soul is to anticipate living in a realm of spiritual bliss in communion with God. The goal of every human person is to attain this communion and bliss with the Divine by living his life on earth in virtue.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;St. Thomas Aquinas - the most eminent thirteenth century scholar and stalwart of the medieval philosophy. St. Thomas claims that man is considerably united body and soul. Man is point of convergence the corporeal and spiritual substances. In other words, man “is one substance body and soul”.  Aquinas said that indeed, man is composed of two parts: matter and form. Matter (body), or hyle in Greek, refers to the “common stuff that makes up all in the universe”. Man’s body is part of this matter. From on the other hand, or morphe (soul) in Greek refers to the essence of a substance or thing. To Aquinas, just as in Aristotle, the soul is what animates the body; it is what makes us humans.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Rene Descartes - Modern Philosophy would have been impossible without this French philosopher who was born in La Haye, Touraine, France in the year 1596. Descartes conceived of the human person as having a body and a mind.he claims that there is so much what we should doubt. In fact, he says that since much of what we think and believe are not infallible, they may turn out to be false. One should believe that since which can pass the test of doubt (Descartes 2008). If something is so clear and lucid as not to be even doubted, then that is the only time when one should buy a proposition. In the end, Descartes thought that the only thing that one cannot doubt is the existence of the self, a thing that thinks and therefore, that cannot be doubted. Thus, his famous, cogito ergo sum,” I think therefore I am”In the end, Descartes thought that the only thing that one cannot doubt is the existence of the self, a thing that thinks and therefore, that cannot be doubted. Thus, his famous, cogito ergo sum,” I think therefore I am”. Descartes calls thinking substance Res Cogitans and extended substance Res Extensa. In Descartes view, the body is nothing else but a machine that is attached to the mind.</p>

                            <br>-&nbsp;<b>Bilateral or Mirror Symmetry</b> - a symmetry that mirrors each side. Ex a Butterfly's wings.
                            <br>-&nbsp;<b>Rotational symmetry or radial symmetry</b> - simply a circle pattern. Ex. a Flower, or a Water-drop falls into water and forms circle waves.
                            <br>-&nbsp;<b>Fivefold symmetry</b> - something that have the same form/pattern on each of its 5 sides. Ex. a Starfish.

                            <p>>&nbsp;A computer is an automatic electronic apparatus for making calculations or controlling operations that are expressible in numerical or logical terms. It is a data processor. It can accept input, which may be either data or instructions or both. The computer remembers the input by storing it in memory cells. It then processes the stored input by performing calculations or by making logical comparisons or both. The computer accepts input and outputs data in an alphanumeric form. Internally it converts the input data to meaningful binary digits, performs the instructed operations on the binary data, and transforms the data from binary digit form to understandable alphanumeric form.</p>
                            <p>-&nbsp;<b>Computing in the mechanical era</b> - The first mechanical calculating apparatus was the <b>abacus</b>, which was invented in <i>500 BC in Babylon</i>. It was used extensively without any improvement until1642 when Blaise Pascal designed a calculator that employed gears and wheels. But it was not until the early 1800s that a practical, geared, mechanical computing calculator became available.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;In <i>1823</i>, <u>Charles Babbage</u>, aided by <u>Augusta Ada Byron</u>, the Countess of Lovelace, started an ambitious project. The Input to this mechanical machine, named the <b>Analytical Engine</b>, was given through punched cards and can store 1,000, 20 digits of decimal numbers. This machine that had more than 50,000 mechanical parts could not operate reliably because the parts could not be machined to precision.</p>
                            <p>-&nbsp;<b>Computing in the electrical era</b> - A mechanical machine, driven by a single electric motor, was developed in <i>1889</i> by <u>Herman Hollerith</u> to count, sort, and collate data stored on punched cards.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;In <i>1941</i>, <u>Konrad Zuse</u> developed the first electronic calculating computer, the <b>Z3</b>. It was used by the Germans in World War II.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;<u>Alan Turing</u> is credited with developing the first electronic computer in 1943. This computer system, named the <b>Colossus</b>, a fixed-program computer and not programmable.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;<u>J.W. Mauchly</u> and <u>S.P. Eckert</u> of the University of Pennsylvania completed the first general-purpose electronic digital computer in <i>1946</i>. Called the <b>ENIAC(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)</b>. It used 17,000 vacuum tubes, over 500 miles of wires, weighed 30 tons, and performed around 100,000 operations per second.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;In the early <i>1950s</i>, Sperry-Rand Corporation launched the <b>Univac I</b>,<b> Univac II</b>, <b>Univac 1103 series</b> while IBM(International Business Machines) brought out <b>Mark I and 701 series</b>. All these machines used vacuum tubes.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;The transistor was invented at <i>Bell Labs in 1948</i>. In <i>1958</i>, IBM, International Computers Limited (ICL), Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), and others brought out general-purpose computers using transistors that were faster, smaller in size, weighed less, needed less power, and were more reliable.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;In <i>1971, Intel Corporation</i> announced the development of the single-chip microprocessor 4004, a very large-scale integrated circuit.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;In <i>1972</i>, the 8008 <b>8-bit microprocessor</b> was introduced, and the 8080 and MC 6800 appeared in 1973, which were improved 8-bit microprocessors.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Though desktop computers were available from <i>1975</i> onwards, none could gain as much popularity as the IBM PC.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;The 80286 <b>16-bit microprocessor</b> came in <i>1983</i>.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;The <b>32-bit microprocessor</b> 80386 arrived in <i>1986</i>.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Along with the development of computer hardware, <b>Programming languages</b> were devised and perfected. In the <i>1950s</i>, Assembly language was developed for univac computers. In <i>1957</i>, IBM developed fortran language. Then in the years that followed came programming languages such as algol, cobol, basic, pascal, c/c++, ada, and java.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;A variety of operating systems are <b>unix</b> (gained popularity) for large and mini-computers, and <b>msdos</b> and <b>ms-windows</b> for personal computers. However, with the availability of <b>linux</b>, a trend to change over to this operating system is on.</p>

                            <br>-&nbsp;Sequence is an ordered list of numbers, called <u>terms</u> that may have repeated values. The arrangement of these terms is set by a definite rule.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;Example:<br>-&nbsp;1, 10, 100, 1000 and so on. The sequence is power by 10<sup>nth</sup>.
                            <br>-&nbsp;2, 5,9,14, 20 and so on. The sequence is obtained by iterating 1 number everytime it adds. Like 2+3=5, then 5+4=9, then 9+5=14. Noticed that the 3 in "2+3" becomes 4 and then it becomes 5 next is 6.</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;The <b>Fibonacci Sequence</b> - is a series of numbers.
                            <br>-&nbsp;0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...
                            <br>The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Like 2+3=5, take 3 and 5, then add it.(Leave the number 2)</p>

                            <p>So term number 6 is called X<sub>6</sub> (which equals 8).
                            <br>For Example: the 8<sup>th</sup> term is the 7<sup>th</sup> term plus the 6<sup>th</sup> term (X<sub>8</sub> = x<sub>7</sub> + X<sub>6</sub>)</p>
                            <p>>&nbsp;<b>The rule is X<sub>n</sub> = X<sub>n-1</sub> + X<sub>n-2</sub></b>

                            <br>-&nbsp;X<sub>n-2</sub> is the term before term n-1 (n-2)</p>

                            <p>>&nbsp;Here is an interesting pattern: <span>(See the table above for illustration)</span>
                            <br>-&nbsp;Look at the number X<sub>3</sub> = 2 . Every 3<sup>rd</sup> number is a multiple of 2 (2, 8, 34, 144, 610, ...)<span>(n = 3, 6, 9, ...)</span>
                            <br>-&nbsp;Look at the number X<sub>4</sub> = 3. Every 4<sup>th</sup> number is a multiple of 3 (3, 21, 144, ...)<span>(n = 4, 8, 12, ...)</span>
                            <br>-&nbsp;Look at the number X<sub>5</sub> = 5. Every 5<sup>th</sup> number is a multiple of 5 (5, 55, 610, ...)<span>(n = 5, 10, 15, ...)</span>
